Underneath the Mediterranean Sea Lara discovers Thor's gauntlet and then has an encounter with an old enemy, Jacqueline Natla, who has been imprisoned by Legend's antagonist, Amanda Evert. Natla tells Lara that the Norse underworld, Helheim and Avalon are one and the same and that she will need to find Thor's Hammer to open the Underworld. Lara soon discovers to find and wield the hammer she will have to find Thor's other gauntlet and his belt, to retrieve these artefacts she must explore underworlds all around the globe, facing the creatures, traps and puzzles that guard them. However, Lara discovers that Helhiem may contain a powerful weapon that could put the world in danger. Lara also finds herself faced with a doppelg\u00e4nger of herself created by Natla, who burns down her house and kills one of Lara's assistants, Alister Fletcher. After finally completing her quest to find Mjolnir, taking her from the Mediterranean to Thailand to her own Manor to Central America then finally to Jan Mayan Island, she goes to Natla one more time and threatens to kill her if she doesn't tell her where Helheim is. Natla gives her the coordinates, but states that she knows the sacred Ritual of Odin, which partially opens the gate and allows Mjolnir to finish the job. Here Amanda enters, but before she and Lara can start fighting, the Doppelg\u00e4nger takes Amanda and throws her down a shaft. Lara almost kills the Atlantean, but stops herself and simply releases her, letting Natla fly ahead to Helheim, beneath the Arctic icecap. With the ritual performed, Lara uses Mjolnir and enters Helheim, battling her way through hoards of Thralls, reanimated corpses of men and yetis protecting the secret at the heart of the city. Along the way, Lara encounters and shoots her mother, who has turned into a Thrall herself, and Natla reveals the true extent of her manipulation of Lara, even going back to when the Atlantean killed Lord Richard Croft when he saw Natla's intentions. Natla goes, saying '[she has] a serpent to raise', leaving the Doppelg\u00e4nger to kill Lara. Amanda saves Lara's life and Lara pursues Natla, who is activating an ancient doomsday device called the Midgard Serpent, which could cause massive volcanic activity across the whole planet and destroy most of humanity, leaving Natla to be the ruler of what's left. Lara successfully destabilises the device and while Natla desperately tries to repair the damage, Lara throws Mjolnir at Natla, sending her down into the pool of deadly Eitr below and bringing the Midgard Serpent down with it. But this causes the pool to slowly rise and, as Amanda comes round from holding off the Yeti Thralls, she states the legend of Thor and the Serpent, ending 'We'll die here, just like your mother'. Lara suddenly sees a dais like the one that brought her mother to Helheim and together Lara and Amanda repair and use it, teleporting into the temple in Nepal.

Now he wakes up in an apartment in New York and is moments away from being shot by a group of bad guys. He doesn't remember much and as he looks into a mirror, a man looks back at him that isn't even near the age of 80. But as all hell breaks loose and mysterious forces tear through the building and the city itself, the question about his looks becomes one of many. To make things even worse, an old enemy decides to return in a search for a powerful stone. So for Carnby a race for survival begins and all signs point to Central Park.\r\n\r\nEdward's mysterious journey is divided into eight episodes that can be played in chronological order or can be accessed directly from the main menu. Once in the game, the player controls Edward either in a 1st-person or a 3rd-person manner either by switching manually or depending on the situation and what item he uses. If he picks up a fire extinguisher for example, the player will be able to extinguish fires with it if he is in 1st-person mode. In 3rd-person mode it instead becomes a deadly weapon or a battering ram.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important since Edward won't find much ammunition for the pistols, shotguns and other weapons in the game. Instead he needs to be creative and use the items he finds or the environment for his advantage. Especially since most enemies can only be permanently killed by burning them, igniting a wooden chair at a nearby fire, or using a lighter and a can of hairspray are Edward's best bets to knock them out.\r\n\r\nFire plays an important role in the game at all times. If not extinguished, it will slowly burn through anything in the vicinity and spread until everything burnable has been reduced to a smoking pile of ash. This behavior can of course be useful to Edward if he for instance wants to get through a closed wooden door and has nothing heavy at hand to force his way.","developers":[2652]},
